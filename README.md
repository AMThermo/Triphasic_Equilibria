# Triphasic_Equilibria
This repository contains the codes necessary to model the phase equilibria of triphasic systems measured at the Cohesion Laboratory (Concepci√≥n University) and the python codes to model such equilibria. At the time the systems included in this repository are:

  - *Water + 1-Butanol + CPME*: Containing VLLE data and modeling of its three-phase line
  - *Water + 1-Butanol + DMC*: Containing VLLE data and modeling of its three-phase line (In construcction)
  - *Water + 1-Butanol + MB*: Containing VLLE data and modeling of its three-phase line (In construcction)
