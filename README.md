# Triphasic_Equilibria
This repository contains the codes necessary to model the phase equilibria of triphasic systems measured at the Cohesion Laboratory (Concepci√≥n University) and the python codes to model such equilibria. At the time the systems included in this repository are:

  - *Water + 1-Butanol + CPME*: Containing VLLE data of the three phase line
